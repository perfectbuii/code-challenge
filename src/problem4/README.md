# Problem 4: Three Ways to Sum to N

Three different implementations to calculate sum from 1 to n.

## Approaches

1. **Iterative**: Simple loop - O(n) time, O(1) space
2. **Formula**: Math formula - O(1) time, O(1) space  
3. **Recursive**: Recursion - O(n) time, O(n) space

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Install make

### Run
```bash
make demo    # See demo
make test    # Run tests
```
